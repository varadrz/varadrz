## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m Varad, a tech-driven engineer who loves building systems that feel fast, reliable, and meaningful.  
From boosting runtime by **75%**, crafting real-time computer vision systems, to building smooth web interfaces—my work is driven by clarity, efficiency, and impact.

Currently interning in a **Data & Business Analytics & Automation** role where I:  
- Improved workflow runtime from **13.48s → 3.4s**  
- Work with automation tools (RPA, Mendix, SAP)  
- Develop scalable, performance-optimized applications  

I enjoy full-stack development, computer vision, cloud technologies, and building projects that solve real problems.
